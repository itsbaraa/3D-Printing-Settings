# Ankermake Slicer Settings
The material used for this design is **ABS** because it offers a good balance between strength and durability unlike PLA which is less durable.

I changed the following settings so the arm joint is sturdy and reliable:
  
1- Decreased the layer height from 0.2mm to 0.1mm to improve the strength and the visual quality.

2- Increased the number of wall loops from 3 to 5 to increase the overall strength of the joint.

3- Increased infill density from 10% to 60% to allow the joint to handle more stress and load.

4- Enabled "Generate Support Material" to generate supports when printing.
